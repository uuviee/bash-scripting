# Descriptions
Every project we work on will be stored in our GitHUb account. 
Everytime, we want to pubish our source code, we have a repeated block of code we want to speed up. 
SO this scrippt will helpl us do exactly that.

Step1 :
Check if current directory is a repository or not.
if [current DIR is a repository ]; then
    publish your code to github
else 
    give error message about the current DIR
    ask teh user for the desired repo and save it as a variable 
    using hte variable change dir to the desired repopublish files to github
fi

Addition:
1. Find repo 
2. Configure GIT

testing to see if any file is gonna get pushed
